r"""
    Supervised tasks are distinguished by their access to ground truth sensors (or environmental metrics) unavailable at test time. We mainly refer to the semantic sensor, here.
    Though, we plan on adding maskrcnn as a dropin for ground truth semantics. As such, we could probably still fine-tune at test.

    TODO: Implementation-wise, supervised tasks will request the attachment of their supervised sensors to the policy.

        Force belief to decode whether goal exists. This is likely going to forward to the vision. We use it
        - in the event that recurrent processing helps a little
        - in hopes it forces the agent to understand where the flag calculation is coming from.
        On the flip side, this task is noisier than just using the flag.
        - This requires test-time semantic sensors. This may not be a problem, but we're not there yet.
        - We should compare the two variants. I can't intuit which is better.

class DeltaPrediction(RolloutAuxTask):
    r"""
        Decode coverage metrics as exploration progress estimation.
        A belief that successfully encodes coverage information and can predict how it changes must encode an internal map that tracks history and unexplored spaces. This would be useful for exploration.
        Specifically, conditioned on:
        - belief
        - actions
        Decode
        - delta in coverage between consecutive steps
        - maybe this should be CEL instead?
        Note: It's tricky to figure out exactly when the delta occurs.
        Other possibilities include:
        - DTW
        - Label smoothing + BCE (not quite satisfying)
        - MSELoss with cumsum. (we're going with this)
        To somewhat help with the tile edge problem, I'll feed in the visit count for the first tile.
        Architecture based off of CPCA.
